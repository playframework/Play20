/**
 * This trait is used to provide a non-blocking timeout on an operation that returns a Future.
 *
 * Please note that the [[play.api.Application]] default ActorSystem should
 * be used as input here, as the actorSystem.scheduler is responsible for scheduling
 * the timeout, using <a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.5/scala/futures.html#After">akka.pattern.actor</a> under the hood.
 *
 * You can dependency inject the ActorSystem as follows to create a Future that will
 * timeout after a certain period of time:
 *
 * {{{
 * class MyService @Inject()(actorSystem: ActorSystem) extends Timeout {
 *
 *   def calculateWithTimeout(timeoutDuration: FiniteDuration): Future[Int] = {
 *     timeout(actorSystem, timeoutDuration)(rawCalculation())
 *   }
 *
 *   def rawCalculation(): Future[Int] = {
 *     import akka.pattern.after
 *     implicit val ec = actorSystem.dispatcher
 *     akka.pattern.after(300 millis, actorSystem.scheduler)(Future(42))(actorSystem.dispatcher)
 *   }
 * }
 * }}}
 *
 * You should check for timeout by using `scala.concurrent.Future.recover` or `scala.concurrent.Future.recoverWith`
 * and checking for [[scala.concurrent.TimeoutException]]:
 *
 * {{{
 * val future = myService.calculateWithTimeout(100 millis).recover {
 *   case _: TimeoutException =>
 *     -1
 * }
 * }}}
 *
 * @see [[http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/futures.html Futures and Promises]]
