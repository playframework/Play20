# Hack to override some of Akka's defaults in Play

# Play's config file loading logic will load this file with a higher
# priority than reference.conf, but a lower priority than application.conf.
# That allows Play to override Akka's reference.conf (which can't happen
# from in Play's own reference.conf), but still allow users to override
# Play's settings in their application.conf.

akka {

  # Turn off dead letters until Akka HTTP server is stable
  log-dead-letters = off

  http.server {
    # Disable Akka-HTTP's transparent HEAD handling. so that play's HEAD handling can take action
    transparent-head-requests = off

    # doesn't work when we set .withRemoteAddressHeader(true) for some reason
    remote-address-header = on
  }

}

# separate config for dev mode
play.akka.dev-mode {
  akka {
    log-dead-letters = off
    http.server {
      transparent-head-requests = off
      remote-address-header = on
    }
  }
}
