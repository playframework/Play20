# The Build System

The Play build system is [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/), a non-intrusive build tool for Scala and Java projects.

## The `/project` directory

Build configuration is declared in your project's `build.sbt` file and in your project's `/project` folder. The `project` folder contains 2 main files:

- `build.properties`: This is a marker file that declares the sbt version used.
- `plugins.sbt`: SBT plugins used by the project build including Play itself.

## Default build for a Play application

The default build description generated by the `play new` command looks like this:

```scala
import play.Project._

name := "Your application"

version := "1.0"

playScalaSettings
```

`playScalaSettings` or `playJavaSettings` is specified to configure sbt for Scala or Java respectively.

> Every sbt feature is available to a Play project.

## Play plugin for sbt

The Play console and all of its development features like live reloading are implemented via an sbt plugin. It is registered in the `plugins.sbt` file:

```scala
addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.play" % "sbt-plugin" % playVersion) // where version is the current Play version, i.e. playVersion := "2.2.0" 
```

> Note that `build.properties` and `plugins.sbt` have to be manually updated when you are changing the play version.

## Adding dependencies and resolvers

Adding dependencies is simple as the build file for the `zentasks` Java sample shows:

```scala
import play.Project._

name := "zentask"

version := "1.0"

libraryDependencies ++= Seq(javaJdbc, javaEbean)     

playJavaSettings
```

...and so are resolvers for adding in additional repositories:

```scala
resolvers += "Repository name" at "http://url.to/repository" 
```
