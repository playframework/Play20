# Learning from Play Examples

[Lightbend Tech Hub](https://developer.lightbend.com/start/?group=play) offers downloadable Play examples for Java and Scala. Play has many features, so rather than pack them all into one project, we've organized many examples that each showcase a Play feature or demonstrate a common use case. The zip files include everything you need to build and run the examples, including a distribution of the sbt and Gradle. Refer to the `README.md` file in the top level project directory to learn more about the example.

If you are new to Play, we recommend following the Hello World tutorial for Java or Scala first:

1. [Play Java Hello World](https://developer.lightbend.com/start/?group=play&project=play-java-hello-world-tutorial)
2. [Play Scala Hello World](https://developer.lightbend.com/start/?group=play&project=play-scala-starter-example)

The tutorial is self-contained; when you run it by following the directions in the readme, the application displays the remaining steps on a web page. You might find it convenient to have [[the same Tutorial instructions|HelloWorldTutorial.md]] open in a different tab or browser window while you are working with the example code. 

> **Note**: the example projects are not configured for out of the box security.
