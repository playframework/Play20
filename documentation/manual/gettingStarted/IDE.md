# Setting up your preferred IDE

Working with Play is easy. You don’t even need a sophisticated IDE, because Play compiles and refreshes the modifications you make to your source files automatically, so you can easily work using a simple text editor.

However, using a modern Java or Scala IDE provides cool productivity features like auto-completion, on-the-fly compilation, assisted refactoring and debugging.

## Eclipse

### Generate configuration

Play provides a command to simplify Eclipse configuration. To transform a Play application into a working Eclipse project, use the `eclipse` command:

```
[my-first-app] $ eclipse
```

If you want to grab the available source jars (this will take longer and it's possible a few sources might be missing):

```
[my-first-app] $ eclipse with-source=true
```

> Note if you are using sub-projects with aggregate, you would need to set `skipParents` appropriately in `build.sbt`:

```
import com.typesafe.sbteclipse.core.EclipsePlugin.EclipseKeys

EclipseKeys.skipParents in ThisBuild := false
```

or from the play console, type:

``` 
[my-first-app] $ eclipse skip-parents=false
```

> Also, if you did not want to trigger a compilation before running `eclipse`, then just add the following to your settings:

```
EclipsePlugin.EclipseKeys.preTasks := Seq()
```

You then need to import the application into your Workspace with the **File/Import/General/Existing project…** menu (compile your project first).

To debug, start your application with `activator -jvm-debug 9999 run` and in Eclipse right-click on the project and select **Debug As**, **Debug Configurations**. In the **Debug Configurations** dialog, right-click on **Remote Java Application** and select **New**. Change **Port** to 9999 and click **Apply**. From now on you can click on **Debug** to connect to the running application. Stopping the debugging session will not stop the server.

> **Tip**: You can run your application using `activator "~ run"` to enable direct compilation on file change. This way scala template files are auto discovered when you create a new template in `view` and auto compiled when the file changes. If you use normal `run` then you have to hit `Refresh` on your browser each time.

If you make any important changes to your application, such as changing the classpath, use `eclipse` again to regenerate the configuration files.

> **Tip**: Do not commit Eclipse configuration files when you work in a team!

The generated configuration files contain absolute references to your framework installation. These are specific to your own installation. When you work in a team, each developer must keep his Eclipse configuration files private.

## IntelliJ

### Generate configuration

Play provides a command to simplify Intellij IDEA configuration. To transform a Play application into a working IDEA module, use the idea command from the play console:

```
[my-first-app] $ idea
```

If you want to grab the available source jars (this will take longer and it's possible a few sources might be missing):

```
[my-first-app] $ idea with-sources=yes
```

This will create the configuration files IntelliJ needs to open your play application as a project. The files are named `<project>.iml` and `<project>-build.iml`. 

Now we can open the project in IntelliJ. To do this select, File, then Open... (IntelliJ 12.1.6) and select the "my-first-app" folder. 

Let's go ahead and run our app in debug mode. As we are already running the Play console we will need to first stop it:

```
[my-first-app] $ exit
```

To debug, first add a debug configuration

- Open Run/Debug Configurations dialog, then click Run, Edit Configurations
- Add a Remote configuration, then select `Remote`
- Configure it:
    - Set a name
    - Transport: Socket
    - Debugger mode: Attach
    - Host: localhost
    - Port: 9999
    - Select module you imported
- Close dialog - click Apply

Start play in debug mode (in a separate command line console, NOT in IDEA's Play console):

```
$ activator -jvm-debug 9999
```

which should print: 

```
Listening for transport dt_socket at address: 9999
```

Set some breakpoints then start your new debug configuration from within IDEA. The console output should be:

```
Connected to the target VM, address: 'localhost:9999', transport: 'socket'
```

Run the web app by executing the task `run` in the Play console. Finally, browse to `http://localhost:9000`. IntelliJ should stop at your breakpoint.

Alternatively, in order not to run more command prompts, first run `activator -jvm-debug 9999 run` in IDEA's Play console, then launch debug configuration.

If you make any important changes to your application, such as changing the classpath, use `idea` again to regenerate the configuration files.


## Netbeans

### Generate Configuration

Play does not have native Netbeans project generation support at this time.


## ENSIME

### Install ENSIME

Follow the installation instructions at <https://github.com/aemoncannon/ensime>

### Generate configuration

Edit your project/plugins.sbt file, and add the following line (you should first check <https://github.com/ensime/ensime-sbt-cmd> for the latest version of the plugin):

```
addSbtPlugin("org.ensime" % "ensime-sbt-cmd" % "0.1.3")
```

Start Play:

```
$ activator
```

Enter 'ensime generate' at the play console. The plugin should generate a .ensime file in the root of your Play project.

```

```

### Start ENSIME

From Emacs, execute M-x ensime and follow the on-screen instructions.

That's all there is to it. You should now get type-checking, completion, etc. for your Play project. Note, if you add new library dependencies to your play project, you'll need to re-run "ensime generate" and re-launch ENSIME.

### More Information

Check out the ENSIME manual at <http://ensime.github.io/ensime-src/index.html>.
If you have questions, post them in the ensime group at <https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/ensime>.


## All Scala Plugins if needed

Scala is a newer programming language, so the functionality is provided in plugins rather than in the core IDE.

- Eclipse Scala IDE: <http://scala-ide.org/>
- NetBeans Scala Plugin: <https://java.net/projects/nbscala>
- IntelliJ IDEA Scala Plugin: <http://confluence.jetbrains.net/display/SCA/Scala+Plugin+for+IntelliJ+IDEA>
- IntelliJ IDEA's plugin is under active development, and so using the nightly build may give you additional functionality at the cost of some minor hiccups.
- Nika (11.x) Plugin Repository: <http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/plugins/scala-nightly-nika.xml>
- Leda (12.x) Plugin Repository: <http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/plugins/scala-nightly-leda.xml>
- IntelliJ IDEA Play plugin (available only for Leda 12.x): <http://plugins.intellij.net/plugin/?idea&pluginId=7080>
- ENSIME - Scala IDE Mode for Emacs: <https://github.com/aemoncannon/ensime>
(see below for ENSIME/Play instructions)
