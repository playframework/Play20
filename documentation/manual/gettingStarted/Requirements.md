# Play Requirements
Play is a series of libraries available in Maven Repository so that you can use any Java or Scala build tool to build a Play project. However, much of the development experience Play is known for (routes, templates compilation and auto-reloading) is provided by sbt or Gradle.

Play requires:

1. Java SE 1.8 or higher
1. A build tool. Choose from:
    1. [sbt](#Verifying-and-installing-sbt) - we recommend the latest version
    1. [Gradle](#Verifying-and-installing-Gradle) - we recommend the latest version

## Verifying and installing Java

To check that you have Java SE 1.8 or higher, enter the following in a terminal:

```bash
java -version
```

You should see something like:

```
java version "1.8.0_121"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_121-b13)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.121-b13, mixed mode)
```

You can obtain Java SE from [Oracleâ€™s JDK Site](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html). 

## Verifying and installing sbt

Play example projects available from [Lightbend Tech Hub](https://developer.lightbend.com/start/?group=play) automatically download dependencies and have `./sbt` and `sbt.bat` launchers for Unix and Windows environments, respectively. You do not have to install sbt to run them.

If you are ready to start your own project and want to use sbt, refer to the [sbt download page](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html) to install the sbt launcher on your system. See [sbt documentation](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Setup-Notes.html) for details about how to setup sbt. We recommend that you use the latest version of sbt. With sbt installed, you can use our [giter8](http://www.foundweekends.org/giter8/) templates for Java or Scala to [[create a new project with a single command|NewApplication]].

## Verifying and installing Gradle

Play example projects available from [Lightbend Tech Hub](https://developer.lightbend.com/start/?group=play) automatically download dependencies and have `./gradlew` or `gradlew.bat` launchers for Unix and Windows environments, respectively. You do not need to install install Gradle to run them.

If you are ready to start your own project and want to use Gradle, refer to [Gradle install page](https://gradle.org/install/) to install Gradle launcher on your system. If you run into problems after installing, check [Gradle's documentation for help](https://docs.gradle.org/4.6/userguide/troubleshooting.html#sec:troubleshooting_installation). We recommend that you use the latest version of Gradle.

## Congratulations!

You are now ready to work with Play!  The next page will show you how to create projects from the command line and some more detail about creating new applications.
