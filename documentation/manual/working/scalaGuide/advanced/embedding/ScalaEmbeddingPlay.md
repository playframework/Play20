#  Embedding a Play server in your application

While Play apps are most commonly used as their own container, you can also embed a Play server into your own existing application.  This can be used in conjunction with the Twirl template compiler and Play routes compiler, but these are of course not necessary, a common use case for embedding a Play application will be because you only have a few very simple routes.
