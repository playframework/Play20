# What's new in Play 2.6

This page highlights the new features of Play 2.6. If you want to learn about the changes you need to make when you migrate to Play 2.6, check out the [[Play 2.6 Migration Guide|Migration26]].

## Akka HTTP Server Backend

Play now uses the [Akka-HTTP](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/scala.html) server engine as the default backend.  More detail about Play's integration with Akka-HTTP can be found [[on the Akka HTTP Server page|AkkaHttpServer]].  There is an additional page on [[configuring Akka HTTP|SettingsAkkaHttp]].

The Netty backend is still available, and has been upgraded to use Netty 4.1.  You can explicitly configure your project to use Netty [[on the NettyServer page|NettyServer]].

## Request attributes

Requests in Play 2.6 now contain *attributes*. Attributes allow you to store extra information inside request objects. For example, you can write a filter that sets an attribute in the request and then access the attribute value later from within your actions.

Attributes are stored in a `TypedMap` that is attached to each request. `TypedMap`s are immutable maps that store type-safe keys and values. Attributes are indexed by a key and the key's type indicates the type of the attribute.

Java:
```java
// Create a TypedKey to store a User object
class Attrs {
  public static final TypedKey<User> USER = TypedKey.<User>create("user");
}

// Get the User object from the request
User user = req.attrs().get(Attrs.USER);
// Put a User object into the request
Request newReq = req.addAttr(Attrs.USER, newUser);
```

Scala:
```scala
// Create a TypedKey to store a User object
object Attrs {
  val User: TypedKey[User] = TypedKey[User].apply("user")
}

// Get the User object from the request
val user: User = req.attrs(Attrs.User)
// Put a User object into the request
val newReq = req.addAttr(Attrs.User, newUser)
```

Attributes are stored in a `TypedMap`. You can read more about attributes in the `TypedMap` documentation: [Javadoc](api/java/play/libs/typedmap/TypedMap.html), [Scaladoc](api/scala/play/api/libs/typedmap/TypedMap.html).

Request tags have now been deprecated and you should migrate to use attributes instead. See the [[tags section|Migration26#Request-tags-deprecation]] in the migration docs for more information.

## Injectable Twirl Templates

Twirl templates can now be created with a constructor annotation using `@this`.  The constructor annotation means that Twirl templates can be injected into templates directly and can manage their own dependencies, rather than the controller having to manage dependencies not only for itself, but also for the templates it has to render.

As an example, suppose a template has a dependency on a component `TemplateRenderingComponent`, which is not used by the controller.

First, add the `@Inject` annotation to Twirl in `build.sbt`:

```scala
TwirlKeys.constructorAnnotations += "@javax.inject.Inject()"
```

Then create a file `IndexTemplate.scala.html` using the `@this` syntax for the constructor. Note that the constructor must be placed **before** the `@()` syntax used for the template's parameters for the `apply` method:

```scala
@this(trc: TemplateRenderingComponent)
@()

@{trc.render(item)}
```

And finally define the controller by injecting the template in the constructor:

```scala
public MyController @Inject()(indexTemplate: views.html.IndexTemplate,
                              cc: ControllerComponents)
  extends AbstractController(cc) {

  def index = Action { implicit request =>
    Ok(indexTemplate())
  }
}
```

or

```java
public class MyController extends Controller {

  private final views.html.indexTemplate template;

  @Inject
  public MyController(views.html.indexTemplate template) {
    this.template = template;
  }

  public Result index() {
    return ok(template.render());
  }

}
```

Once the template is defined with its dependencies, then the controller can have the template injected into the controller, but the controller does not see `TemplateRenderingComponent`.

## Filters Enhancements

Play now comes with a default set of enabled filters, defined through configuration.  This provides a "secure by default" experience for new Play applications, and tightens security on existing Play applications.

The following filters are enabled by default:

* `play.filters.csrf.CSRFFilter` prevents CSRF attacks, see [[ScalaCsrf]] / [[JavaCsrf]]
* `play.filters.headers.SecurityHeadersFilter` prevents XSS and frame origin attacks, see [[SecurityHeaders]]
* `play.filters.hosts.AllowedHostsFilter` prevents DNS rebinding attacks, see [[AllowedHostsFilter]]

In addition, filters can now be configured through `application.conf`.  To append to the defaults list, use the `+=`:

```
play.filters.enabled+=MyFilter
```

If you want to specifically disable a filter for testing, you can also do that from configuration:

```
play.filters.disabled+=MyFilter
```

Please see [[the Filters page|Filters]] for more details.

> **NOTE**: If you are migrating from an existing project that does not use CSRF form helpers such as `CSRF.formField`, then you may see "403 Forbidden" on PUT and POST requests, from the CSRF filter.  To check this behavior, please add `<logger name="play.filters.csrf" value="TRACE"/>` to your `logback.xml`.  Likewise, if you are running a Play application on something other than localhost, you must configure the [[AllowedHostsFilter]] to specifically allow the hostname/ip you are connecting from.

## JWT Cookies

Play now uses [JSON Web Token](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519) (JWT) format for session and flash cookies.  This allows for a standardized signed cookie data format, cookie expiration (making replay attacks harder) and more flexibility in signing cookies.

Please see [[Scala|ScalaSessionFlash]] or [[Java|JavaSessionFlash]] pages for more details.

## Logging Marker API

 SLF4J Marker support has been added to [`play.Logger`](api/java/play/Logger.html) and [`play.api.Logger`](api/scala/play/api/Logger.html).

In the Java API, it is a straight port of the SLF4J Logger API.  This is useful, but you may find an SLF4J wrapper like [Godaddy Logger](https://github.com/godaddy/godaddy-logger) for a richer logging experience.

In the Scala API, markers are added through a MarkerContext trait, which is added as an implicit parameter to the logger methods, i.e.

```scala
import play.api._
logger.info("some info message")(MarkerContext(someMarker))
```

This opens the door for implicit markers to be passed for logging in several statements, which makes adding context to logging much easier without resorting to MDC.  In particular, see what you can do with the [Logstash Logback Encoder](https://github.com/logstash/logstash-logback-encoder#event-specific-custom-fields):

@[logging-request-context-trait](../../working/scalaGuide/main/logging/code/ScalaLoggingSpec.scala)

And then used in a controller and carried through `Future` that may use different execution contexts:

@[logging-log-info-with-request-context](../../working/scalaGuide/main/logging/code/ScalaLoggingSpec.scala)

Note that marker contexts are also very useful for "tracer bullet" style logging, where you want to log on a specific request without explicitly changing log levels.  For example, you can add a marker only when certain conditions are met:

@[logging-log-trace-with-tracer-controller](../../working/scalaGuide/main/logging/code/ScalaLoggingSpec.scala)

And then trigger logging with the following TurboFilter in `logback.xml`: 

```xml
<turboFilter class="ch.qos.logback.classic.turbo.MarkerFilter">
  <Name>TRACER_FILTER</Name>
  <Marker>TRACER</Marker>
  <OnMatch>ACCEPT</OnMatch>
</turboFilter>
```

For more information, please see [[ScalaLogging]] or [[JavaLogging]].

For more information about using Markers in logging, see [TurboFilters](https://logback.qos.ch/manual/filters.html#TurboFilter) and [marker based triggering](https://logback.qos.ch/manual/appenders.html#OnMarkerEvaluator) sections in the Logback manual.

## Security Logging

A security marker has been added for security related operations in Play, and failed security checks now log  at WARN level, with the security marker set.  This ensures that developers always know why a particular request is failing, which is important now that security filters are enabled by default in Play.

The security marker also allows security failures to be triggered or filtered distinct from normal logging.  For example, to disable all logging with the SECURITY marker set, add the following lines to the `logback.xml` file:

```xml
<turboFilter class="ch.qos.logback.classic.turbo.MarkerFilter">
    <Marker>SECURITY</Marker>
    <OnMatch>DENY</OnMatch>
</turboFilter>
```

In addition, log events using the security marker can also trigger a message to a Security Information & Event Management (SEIM) engine for further processing.

## Configuring a Custom Logging Framework in Java

Before, if you want to [[use a custom logging framework|SettingsLogger#Using-a-Custom-Logging-Framework]], you had to configure it using Scala, even if the you have a Java project. Now it is possible to create custom `LoggerConfigurator` in both Java and Scala. To create a `LoggerConfigurator` in Java, you need to implement the given interface, for example, to configure Log4J:

```java
import com.typesafe.config.Config;
import com.typesafe.config.ConfigFactory;
import org.slf4j.ILoggerFactory;
import play.Environment;
import play.LoggerConfigurator;
import play.Mode;
import play.api.PlayException;

import java.io.File;
import java.net.URISyntaxException;
import java.net.URL;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Optional;

import org.apache.logging.log4j.LogManager;
import org.apache.logging.log4j.core.*;
import org.apache.logging.log4j.core.config.Configurator;

public class JavaLog4JLoggerConfigurator implements LoggerConfigurator {

    private ILoggerFactory factory;

    @Override
    public void init(File rootPath, Mode mode) {
        Map<String, String> properties = new HashMap<>();
        properties.put("application.home", rootPath.getAbsolutePath());

        String resourceName = "log4j2.xml";
        URL resourceUrl = this.getClass().getClassLoader().getResource(resourceName);
        configure(properties, Optional.ofNullable(resourceUrl));
    }

    @Override
    public void configure(Environment env) {
        Map<String, String> properties = LoggerConfigurator.generateProperties(env, ConfigFactory.empty(), Collections.emptyMap());
        URL resourceUrl = env.resource("log4j2.xml");
        configure(properties, Optional.ofNullable(resourceUrl));
    }

    @Override
    public void configure(Environment env, Config configuration, Map<String, String> optionalProperties) {
        // LoggerConfigurator.generateProperties enables play.logger.includeConfigProperties=true
        Map<String, String> properties = LoggerConfigurator.generateProperties(env, configuration, optionalProperties);
        URL resourceUrl = env.resource("log4j2.xml");
        configure(properties, Optional.ofNullable(resourceUrl));
    }

    @Override
    public void configure(Map<String, String> properties, Optional<URL> config) {
        try {
            LoggerContext loggerContext = (LoggerContext) LogManager.getContext(false);
            loggerContext.setConfigLocation(config.get().toURI());

            factory = org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder.getSingleton().getLoggerFactory();
        } catch (URISyntaxException ex) {
            throw new PlayException(
                "log4j2.xml resource was not found",
                "Could not parse the location for log4j2.xml resource",
                ex
            );
        }
    }

    @Override
    public ILoggerFactory loggerFactory() {
        return factory;
    }

    @Override
    public void shutdown() {
        LoggerContext loggerContext = (LoggerContext) LogManager.getContext();
        Configurator.shutdown(loggerContext);
    }
}
```

> **Note**: this implementation is fully compatible with Scala version `LoggerConfigurator` and can even be used in Scala projects if necessary, which means that module creators can provide a Java or Scala implementation of LoggerConfigurator and they will be usable in both Java and Scala projects.

## Java Compile Time Components

Just as Scala, Play now has components to enable [[Java Compile Time Dependency Injection|JavaCompileTimeDependencyInjection]]. The components were created as interfaces that you should `implements` and they provide default implementations. There are components for all the types that could be injected when using [[Runtime Dependency Injection|JavaDependencyInjection]]. To create an application using Compile Time Dependency Injection, you just need to provide an implementation of `play.ApplicationLoader` that uses a custom implementation of `play.BuiltInComponents`, for example:

```java
import play.routing.Router;
import play.ApplicationLoader;
import play.BuiltInComponentsFromContext;
import play.filters.components.HttpFiltersComponents;

public class MyComponents extends BuiltInComponentsFromContext
        implements HttpFiltersComponents {

    public MyComponents(ApplicationLoader.Context context) {
        super(context);
    }

    @Override
    public Router router() {
        return Router.empty();
    }
}
```

The `play.ApplicationLoader`:
 
```java
import play.ApplicationLoader;

public class MyApplicationLoader implements ApplicationLoader {

    @Override
    public Application load(Context context) {
        return new MyComponents(context).application();
    }

}
```

And configure `MyApplicationLoader` as explained in [[Java Compile-Time Dependency Injection docs|JavaCompileTimeDependencyInjection#Application-entry-point]].

## Improved Form Handling I18N support

The `MessagesApi` and `Lang` classes are used for internationalization in Play, and are required to display error messages in forms.

In the past, putting together a form in Play has required [multiple steps](https://www.theguardian.com/info/developer-blog/2015/dec/30/how-to-add-a-form-to-a-play-application), and the creation of a `Messages` instance from a request was not discussed in the context of form handling. 

In addition, it was inconvenient to have a `Messages` instance passed through all template fragments when form handling was required, and `Messages` implicit support was provided directly through the controller trait.  The I18N API has been refined with the addition of a `MessagesProvider` trait, implicits that are tied directly to requests, and the forms documentation has been improved.

The [`MessagesActionBuilder`](api/scala/play/api/mvc/MessagesActionBuilder.html) has been added.  This action builder provides a [`MessagesRequest`](api/scala/play/api/mvc/MessagesRequest.html), which is a [`WrappedRequest`](api/scala/play/api/mvc/WrappedRequest.html) that extends [`MessagesProvider`](api/scala/play/api/i18n/MessagesProvider.html), only a single implicit parameter needs to be made available to templates, and you don't need to extend `Controller` with `I18nSupport`.  This is also useful because to use [[CSRF|ScalaCsrf]] with forms, both a `Request` (technically a `RequestHeader`) and a `Messages` object must be available to the template.

```scala
class FormController @Inject()(messagesAction: MessagesActionBuilder, components: ControllerComponents)
  extends AbstractController(components) {

  import play.api.data.Form
  import play.api.data.Forms._

  val userForm = Form(
    mapping(
      "name" -> text,
      "age" -> number
    )(UserData.apply)(UserData.unapply)
  )

  def index = messagesAction { implicit request: MessagesRequest[AnyContent] =>
    Ok(views.html.displayForm(userForm))
  } 
  
  def post = ...  
}
```

where `displayForm.scala.html` is defined as:

```twirl
@(userForm: Form[UserData])(implicit request: MessagesRequestHeader)

@import helper._

@helper.form(action = routes.FormController.post()) {
  @CSRF.formField                     @* <- takes a RequestHeader    *@
  @helper.inputText(userForm("name")) @* <- takes a MessagesProvider *@
  @helper.inputText(userForm("age"))  @* <- takes a MessagesProvider *@
}
```

For more information, please see [[ScalaI18N]].

### Testing Support

Support for creating `MessagesApi` instances has been improved.  Now, when you want to create a [`MessagesApi`](api/scala/play/api/i18n/MessagesApi.html) instance, you can create [`DefaultMessagesApi()`](api/scala/play/api/i18n/DefaultMessagesApi.html) or [`DefaultLangs()`](api/scala/play/api/i18n/DefaultLangs.html) with default arguments.  If you want to specify test messages from configuration or from another source, you can pass in those values:

```scala
val messagesApi: MessagesApi = {
    val env = new Environment(new File("."), this.getClass.getClassLoader, Mode.Dev)
    val config = Configuration.reference ++ Configuration.from(Map("play.i18n.langs" -> Seq("en", "fr", "fr-CH")))
    val langs = new DefaultLangsProvider(config).get
    new DefaultMessagesApi(testMessages, langs)
  }
```

## Future Timeout and Delayed Support

Play's support for futures in asynchronous operations has been improved, using the `Futures` trait.

You can use the [`play.libs.concurrent.Futures`](api/java/play/libs/concurrent/Futures.html) interface to wrap a `CompletionStage` in a non-blocking timeout:

```java
class MyClass {
    @Inject
    public MyClass(Futures futures) {
        this.futures = futures;
    }

    CompletionStage<Double> callWithOneSecondTimeout() {
        return futures.timeout(computePIAsynchronously(), Duration.ofSeconds(1));
    }
}
```

or use [`play.api.libs.concurrent.Futures`](api/scala/play/api/libs/concurrent/Futures.html) trait in the Scala API:

```scala
import play.api.libs.concurrent.Futures._

class MyController @Inject()(cc: ControllerComponents)(implicit futures: Futures) extends AbstractController(cc) {

  def index = Action.async {
    // withTimeout is an implicit type enrichment provided by importing Futures._
    intensiveComputation().withTimeout(1.seconds).map { i =>
      Ok("Got result: " + i)
    }.recover {
      case e: TimeoutException =>
        InternalServerError("timeout")
    }
  }
}
```

There is also a `delayed` method which only executes a `Future` after a specified delay, which works similarly to timeout.

For more information, please see [[ScalaAsync]] or [[JavaAsync]].

## CustomExecutionContext and Thread Pool Sizing

This class defines a custom execution context that delegates to an akka.actor.ActorSystem.  It is very useful for situations in which the default execution context should not be used, for example if a database or blocking I/O is being used.  Detailed information can be found in the [[ThreadPools]] page, but Play 2.6.x adds a `CustomExecutionContext` class that handles the underlying Akka dispatcher lookup.

## Updated Templates with Preconfigured CustomExecutionContexts

All of the Play example templates on [Play's download page](https://playframework.com/download#examples) that use blocking APIs (i.e. Anorm, JPA) have been updated to use custom execution contexts where appropriate.  For example, going to https://github.com/playframework/play-java-jpa-example/ shows that the [JPAPersonRepository](https://github.com/playframework/play-java-jpa-example/blob/4f962bc/app/models/JPAPersonRepository.java) class takes a `DatabaseExecutionContext` that wraps all the database operations.

For thread pool sizing involving JDBC connection pools, you want a fixed thread pool size matching the connection pool, using a thread pool executor.  Following the advice in [HikariCP's pool sizing page](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP/wiki/About-Pool-Sizing), you should configure your JDBC connection pool to double the number of physical cores, plus the number of disk spindles.

The dispatcher settings used here come from [Akka dispatcher](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.5/java/dispatchers.html):

```
# db connections = ((physical_core_count * 2) + effective_spindle_count)
fixedConnectionPool = 9

database.dispatcher {
  executor = "thread-pool-executor"
  throughput = 1
  thread-pool-executor {
    fixed-pool-size = ${fixedConnectionPool}
  }
}
```

### Defining a CustomExecutionContext in Scala

To define a custom execution context, subclass [`CustomExecutionContext`](api/scala/play/api/libs/concurrent/CustomExecutionContext.html) with the dispatcher name:

```scala
@Singleton
class DatabaseExecutionContext @Inject()(system: ActorSystem)
   extends CustomExecutionContext(system, "database.dispatcher")
```

Then have the execution context passed in as an implicit parameter:

```scala
class DatabaseService @Inject()(implicit executionContext: DatabaseExecutionContext) {
  ...
}
```

### Defining a CustomExecutionContext in Java

To define a custom execution context, subclass [`CustomExecutionContext`](api/java/play/libs/concurrent/CustomExecutionContext.html) with the dispatcher name:

```java
import akka.actor.ActorSystem;
import play.libs.concurrent.CustomExecutionContext;

public class DatabaseExecutionContext
        extends CustomExecutionContext {

    @javax.inject.Inject
    public DatabaseExecutionContext(ActorSystem actorSystem) {
        // uses a custom thread pool defined in application.conf
        super(actorSystem, "database.dispatcher");
    }
}
```

Then pass the JPA context in explicitly:

```java
public class JPAPersonRepository implements PersonRepository {

    private final JPAApi jpaApi;
    private final DatabaseExecutionContext executionContext;

    @Inject
    public JPAPersonRepository(JPAApi jpaApi, DatabaseExecutionContext executionContext) {
        this.jpaApi = jpaApi;
        this.executionContext = executionContext;
    }

    ...
}
```
