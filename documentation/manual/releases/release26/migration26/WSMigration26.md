# Play WS Migration Guide

Play WS is now a standalone project and is available at [https://github.com/playframework/play-ws](https://github.com/playframework/play-ws). It can be added to an SBT project with:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.typesafe.play" %% "play-ahc-ws-standalone" % "1.0.0"
libraryDependencies += "com.typesafe.play" %% "play-ahc-ws-standalone-json" % "1.0.0"
libraryDependencies += "com.typesafe.play" %% "play-ahc-ws-standalone-xml" % "1.0.0"
```

## Package changes

Play WS historically consisted of two libraries, `ws` and `playWs`, containing the Scala and Java APIs respectively, each individually creating an AsyncHTTPClient behind the scenes.  There is now only one `play-ahc-ws` library, which contains both Scala and Java `WSClient` instances, and both point to a singleton `AsyncHttpClient` provider.

## Project changes

Play WS now exists as a Play specific wrapper on top of a standalone WS library, which does not depend on Play classes, and which uses package renamed "shaded" versions of AsyncHttpClient, Signpost, and Netty 4.0.

By providing a standalone WS version and using shaded libraries, WS is more flexible and has fewer collisions with other libraries and projects.

The Play WS API extends Standalone WS `post` with `Http.Multipart` and `Multipart` types that are only available in Play, for example:

```scala
def withBody(body: Source[MultipartFormData.Part[Source[ByteString, _]], _]): Self 
```

Signpost OAuth has been changed so that instead of using the Commons HTTPClient OAuthProvider, it now uses the DefaultOAuthProvider, which uses HTTPURLConnection under the hood.

## API changes

### Scala

The `WSAPI` class has been removed.  The `WSClient` interface is the point of entry for the WS API.

`WSRequest` had a `withBody[T](body: T)(implicit writable: play.api.http.Writable[T])` method has been replaced as it was difficult to track the behavior of `Writable`. There is now a custom `BodyWritable[T]` type class that fills the same function, and which has type class instances defined in Standalone WS:

```scala
override def withBody[T: BodyWritable](body: T)
```

The deprecated Scala singleton object `play.api.libs.ws.WS` has been removed.  An instance of `WSClient` should be used instead.  If compile time dependency injection is being used, then the `AhcWSComponents` trait should be mixed in.

For Guice, there is a `WSClient` available in the system:

```scala
class MyService @Inject()(ws: WSClient) {
   def call(): Unit = {     
     ws.url("http://localhost:9000/foo").get()
   }
}
```

If you cannot use an injected WSClient instance, then you can also create your [[own instance of WSClient|ScalaWS#using-wsclient]], but you are then responsible for managing the lifecycle of the client.

If you are running a functional test, you can use the `play.api.test.WsTestClient`, which will start up and shut down a standalone WSClient instance:

```scala
play.api.test.WsTestClient.withClient { ws =>
  ws.url("http://localhost:9000/foo").get()
}
```

The `ning` package has been replaced by the `ahc` package, and the Ning* classes replaced by AHC*.

A normal `WSResponse` instance is returned from `stream()` instead of `StreamedResponse`.  You should call `response.bodyAsSource` to return the streamed result.

### Java

In Java, the `play.libs.ws.WS` class has been deprecated.  An injected `WSClient` instance should be used instead.

```java
public class MyService {
     private final WSClient ws;

     @Inject
     public MyService(WSClient ws) {
         this.ws = ws;
     }

     public void call() {     
         ws.url("http://localhost:9000/foo").get();
     }
}
```

If you cannot use an injected WSClient instance, then you can also create your [[own instance of WSClient|JavaWS#using-wsclient]], but you are then responsible for managing the lifecycle of the client.

If you are running a functional test, you can use the `play.test.WsTestClient`, which will start up and shut down a standalone `WSClient` instance:

```java
WSClient ws = play.test.WsTestClient.newClient(19001);
...
ws.close();
```

A normal `WSResponse` instance is returned from `stream()` instead of `StreamedResponse`.  You should call `response.getBodyAsSource()` to return the streamed result.
