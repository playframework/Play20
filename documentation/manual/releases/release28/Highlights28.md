# What's new in Play 2.8

This page highlights the new features of Play 2.8. If you want to learn about the changes you need to make when you migrate to Play 2.8, check out the [[Play 2.8 Migration Guide|Migration28]].

## Akka 2.6

Play 2.8 brings the latest minor version of Akka. Although Akka 2.6 is binary compatible with 2.5, there are changes in the default configurations and some deprecated features were removed. You can see more details about the changes in [Akka 2.6 migration guide][akka-migration-guide].

[akka-migration-guide]: https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.6/project/migration-guide-2.5.x-2.6.x.html

### Jackson `ObjectMapper` configuration

Instead of providing its way to create and configure an `ObjectMapper`, which before Play 2.8 requires the user to write a custom binding if some customization is required, Play now uses Akka Jackson support to provide an `ObjectMapper`. It means that it is now possible to add Jackson [Modules](http://fasterxml.github.io/jackson-databind/javadoc/2.9/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/Module.html) and configure [Features](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/wiki/JacksonFeatures) using `application.conf`. For example, if you want to add [Joda support](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-datatype-joda), you just need to add the following configuration:

```HOCON
akka.serialization.jackson.jackson-modules += "com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype.joda.JodaModule"
```

And if you need to write numbers as strings, add the following configuration:

```HOCON
akka.serialization.jackson.serialization-features.WRITE_NUMBERS_AS_STRINGS=true
```

### Guice support for Akka Actor Typed

The pre-existing `AkkaGuiceSupport` utility, which helped bind Akka's "classic" actors, has gained additional methods to support Akka 2.6's new [Typed Actor API][].

[Typed Actor API]: https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.6/typed/actors.html

Here's a quick example, in Scala, of defining a Guice module which binds a `HelloActor`:

```scala
object AppModule extends AbstractModule with AkkaGuiceSupport {
  override def configure() = {
    bindTypedActor(HelloActor(), "hello-actor")
  }
}
```

And again, in Java, where the actor extends Akka's Java DSL `AbstractBehavior`:

```java
public final class AppModule extends AbstractModule
    implements AkkaGuiceSupport {
  @Override
  protected void configure() {
    bindTypedActor(HelloActor.class, "hello-actor");
  }
}
```

See [[Integrating with Akka Typed|AkkaTyped]] for more details.

## Other additions

### Build additions

When adding Akka moodules to your application, it is important that you use a consistent version of Akka for all the modules since [mixed versioning is not allowed](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/common/binary-compatibility-rules.html#mixed-versioning-is-not-allowed). To make it easier, `play.core.PlayVersion` object now adds `akkaVersion` so that you can use it in your builds like:

```scala
import play.core.PlayVersion.akkaVersion

libraryDependencies += "com.typesafe.akka" %% "akka-cluster" % akkaVersion
```

### Lang cookie max age configuration

It is now possible to configure a max age for language cookie. To do that, add the following to your `application.conf`:

```HOCON
play.i18n.langCookieMaxAge = 15 seconds
```

By the default, the configuration is `null` meaning no max age will be set for Lang cookie.
