# Validation Inception

> This feature is experimental such as Scala Macros which are flagged experimental in Scala 2.10.0.
> If you would rather not use Scala experimental features, just stick to hand-written `Rule` / `Write` which are strictly equivalent.

## Introduction

The validation API provides macro-based helpers to generate `Rule` and `Write` for case classes (or any class with a companion object providing `apply` / and `unapply` methods).

The generated code:

- is completely typesafe
- is compiled
- does not rely on runtime introspection **at all**
- is strictly equivalent to a hand-written definition

## Example

Traditionally, for a given case class `Person` we would define a `Rule` like this:

@[macro-person-def](code/ScalaValidationMacros.scala)

@[macro-manual](code/ScalaValidationMacros.scala)

Let's test it:

@[macro-manual-test](code/ScalaValidationMacros.scala)

The exact same `Rule` can be generated using `Rule.gen`:

@[macro-macro](code/ScalaValidationMacros.scala)

The validation result is identical :

@[macro-macro-test](code/ScalaValidationMacros.scala)

Similarly we can generate a `Write`:

@[macro-write](code/ScalaValidationMacros.scala)

## Known limitations

 - **Donâ€™t override the apply method of the companion object.** The macro inspects the `apply` method to generate `Rule`/`Write`. Overloading the `apply` method creates an ambiguity the compiler will complain about.
 - **Macros only work when `apply` and `unapply` have corresponding input/output types**. This is naturally true for case classes. However if you want to validate a trait, you must implement the same `apply`/`unapply` you would have in a case class.
 - **Validation Macros accept `Option`/`Seq`/`List`/`Set` & `Map[String, _]`**. For other generic types, you'll have to test and possibly write your `Rule`/`Write` if it's not working out of the box.
